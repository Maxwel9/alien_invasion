# Note:
# In Pygame, the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the screen, and
# coordinates increase as you go down and to the right. On a 1200 by 800
# screen, the origin is at the top-left corner, and the bottom-right corner has
# the coordinates (1200, 800). These coordinates refer to the game window, not
# the physical screen.

# Note:
# Notice that we never make more than one ship; we make only one ship instance
# for the whole game and recenter it whenever the ship has been hit. The
# statistics ships_left will tell us when the player has run out of ships.
